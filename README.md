# Task manager project (2025)
The repository for the Task manager (Project 1) of Testing Academy course (ENGETO)

---

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository showcasing the outcome of a three-month online course (Aprilâ€“July 2025) focused on software testing ([ENGETO - Testing Academy](https://engeto.cz/testovani-softwaru/)). It provides access to the first project, which involved using VS Code to develop a Python program (in Czech) functioning as a task manager. The goal was to implement individual functions for adding, displaying, and removing tasks.
